##Lorem is not Ipsum

>Task : Nothing just take a look on it

##Writeup
After some coffee, I found something different in every files.

So.. what we have to do is
  + Read 1.loremipsum to 63.loremipsum
  + Compare it with 0.loremipsum
  + Store the differences
  + Split by `ITRACE{` trough `}`
  
###"Python it and get it done"
  
##Flag
###`ITRACE{similiriti_similikiti}`
